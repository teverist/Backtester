# Event-driven Backtester in C++
---


## What is this

This is a simple event-driven backtester written in C++. Based on the QuantStart tutorial [here](https://www.quantstart.com/articles/Event-Driven-Backtesting-with-Python-Part-I/), I decided to implement the basic structure (but in C++). 

# Getting Started 

## Prerequisites

You will need to have a Linux-based system (or WSL) with the following installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential 
```

## Installing

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teverist/backtester.git
cd backtester
./build.sh
```

## To run
    
```bash 
./build/backtester
```


# What's next

See TODO for a list of things I want to implement.
